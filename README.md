Software Testing Automation

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Testing software is a part of development. In fact writing automated tests is really just a part of the Software Development Life Cycle. 
Creating tests helps us prove that our product will meet customer or user needs. It also helps in development since we will be able to show 
that our changes are actually working as intended or that they don't break the build. This ensures secure, timely, software delivery.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

It is necessary to meet with the user or customer and gain their feedback. In an agile development world the customer is a part of this process
and in the trenches with the developers. They meet and help test the product at the end of every cycle. Incorporating these needs and writing tests
will help both the developer and user get closer to a complete product.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software with an emphasis on the scientific method and the software development lifecycle. The pragmatic programmer series
has a great approach to this in that we believe that writing tests is actually just development. You're proving your (or your programs) salt and that 
it is up to the task. By developing as one would engineer a bridge or other physical product, you have a mindset where we are experimenting and finding solutions
to complex abstract requirements.
